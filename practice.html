        In May of 2022, I am planning on starting a 5 week internship in Israel that will last halfway through June. The internship is through a program called Onward Israel, and the specific program in which I will be partaking is geared towards camp counselors, which is also something I am planning on doing this summer. The internship itself will be located in Tel Aviv, where I am hoping to be involved in the journalism field in some sort of way. I'm really looking forward to this program because some of my friends from camp will be there with me as well, and when we aren't doing our internship, we can explore Tel Aviv and the surrounding areas.

        June will probably be my busiest month of the summer because my internship, which will start on May 16 (at least that is when the flight is) will end on June 19. I'll fly home and immediately pack for my camp where I will be a counselor. I have to be at camp on June 22 for the start of staff week, where the bunk counselors go through trainings to prepare them for scenarios that they may encounter throughout the summer. Also during staff week, we receive our bunk assignments which tell us which bunk we will be a counselor for, as well as our co-counselors and our day off. The campers will arrive on June 29.

        July and August will be the fun months, not that I won't have any fun in May and June. I grouped them together because I will be at camp pretty much the entirety of the two months, except for my days off and the roughly 10 days I will have in between when I am at camp and when I come back to school for Fall semester. I call them the fun months because they'll be chalk full of fun as I'll be planning stuff for my campers like bunk nights, which is where the camp splits up and does an evening activity with just their bunk, bunk bonding activities, and most importantly, Color War, where the camp splits into two teams, Green and Yellow, and competes for 3 days. I will be a lifeguard at the pool and the lake, and I hope to make my campers' summer the best they've ever had.
